     <h3>Validation of forms and using fetch</h3>
    <p> In order to validate forms there are 2 types client side and server side validation.
        client side validation can be done with the html build in but this is not consider safe. 
        Javascript offers some libraries and is safer. You can use  custom validation done by you or you can use 
        The Constraint Validation API. </p>
