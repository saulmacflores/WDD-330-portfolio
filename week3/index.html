    <h1>week 3 notes</h1>
   <p id="para">
       This week I was able to learn more about functions and the different ones that JS provides such as an <bold>arrow function</bold>
       that is just a compact function with a slighly different sintax, and they can't be used as methods. <bold>anonymous function</bold> is just a function without a name.

       Events provide the link between the web page and user interactions.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bubbling is when the event fires on the element clicked on first, then bubbles up the document tree, 
    firing an event on each parent element until it reaches the root node.
    Capturing starts by firing an event on the root element, then propagates downwards, 
    firing an event on each child element until it reaches the target element that was clicked on.
