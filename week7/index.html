     <h3>Ajax/ Form Data interface </h3>
     <p>
      The FormData interface really comes into its own when a form contains files to upload. This was a notoriously difficult task in the past, 
      often requiring the use of Flash or another third-party browser plugin to handle the upload process. 
      The FormData instance will automatically create the necessary settings required, 
      and take care of all the hard work if any file uploads are present in the form.
